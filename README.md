### DIY Blockchain Projects

Hello dear visitor, this is not a professional course but you may take it as a roadmap from a person who tried build 4 basic blockchain projects and deploying and testing them with frontend in 2-3 days.
Best of luck ahead and remember to tell your favourite people that you really like them. (i cant)

- Tocken Transfer finally working lazy enough to deploy the frontend but contract is live at: 0x06835fcB33D8992aA547A6c6602BbB9305120522 (10-10-2024)
now we come back tomorrow to wipe the remaining corpses from the floor of this blood of blockchain abyss


- SupplyChainTracker's contract address is live at 0x0621473f4312e84E8E704A5543AEDd47b32F0B8F

- Voting dapp contract address is live at 0x645244933f5D166c456847ce7f8DF11FaDE3Cb4e

-not enough sepolia testnet ;-; to deploy the marketplace contract

But heyy atleast now i know how the functions and gas pricing works, next step from here is to learn price optimization and how to actually work with main net and build something that people can use , because right now all is being done on test net.
